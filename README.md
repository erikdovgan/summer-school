# SYNERGY SUMMER SCHOOL 

The Jupyter notebook presents the optimization of a real-world problem (Welded Beam Design) with a multiobjective optimization algorithm (NSGA2)

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the notebook up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 

# Prerequisites
Conda, for example, Miniconda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

Documentation: http://conda.pydata.org/docs

# Installing
1. Download source files from git: 
```
git clone https://github.com/synergy-project/summer-school 
```
2. Go to folder of source files: 
```
cd summer-school-master
```
3. Create Conda environment:
```   
conda env create -n synergy-summer-school -f environment.yml
```
4. Activate environment (to be done each time you open a new terminal window):

Windows:
```
activate synergy-summer-school
```
Linux:
```
source activate synergy-summer-school 
```

# Compiling external library
If the precompiled libraries (EvaluationFunctions.so or EvaluationFunctions.dll) are not compatible with the local system, they should be recompiled.
To this end, execute:

Windows:
```
g++ -c EvaluationFunctions.cpp
g++ -shared -o EvaluationFunctions.dll EvaluationFunctions.o -Wl,--out-implib,libexample_dll.a
```
Linux:   
```
g++ -fPIC -shared EvaluationFunctions.cpp -o EvaluationFunctions.so
```
   
# Running
Execute command:
```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=.
```
   
# Uninstalling
1. Remove folder with source files
2. Uninstall Conda environment:
```
conda env remove -n synergy-summer-school
```
3. Remove Conda
